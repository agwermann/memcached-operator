# MemCached Operator Example

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Create the kind cluster:

```sh
kind create cluster
```

2. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

3. Build your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build IMG=dev.local/memcached-operator:0.1
```

4. Push your image to the location specified by `IMG` (optional):

```sh
make docker-push IMG=dev.local/memcached-operator:0.1
```

5. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=dev.local/memcached-operator:0.1
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

## Create new API Project

```sh
operator-sdk init --domain agwermann \                    
  --repo github.com/agwermann/memcached-operator

operator-sdk create api --group cache --version v1alpha1 \
  --kind Memcached --resource --controller
```

## 

```
export IMG=dev.local/memcached-operator:0.1
export NAMESPACE=memcache-demo-project

cd config/manager
kustomize edit set image controller=${IMG}
kustomize edit set namespace "${NAMESPACE}"
cd ../../

cd config/default
kustomize edit set namespace "${NAMESPACE}"
cd ../../
```
